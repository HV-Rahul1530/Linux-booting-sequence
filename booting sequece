1. **BIOS :** The first program to get executed in the read only memory on motherboard of computer is basic input/output system or bios.

 > BIOS performs POST ( power-on self-test) which verifies the hardware components and peripheral to ensure if computer is in working condition.

> Check for bootable device like pendrive, hardisk, etc.

> Handover control to first sector of device i.e. MBR

**UEFI** (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is used also used apart from BIOS.

1. **Master Boost Record(MBR)**

> 512 bytes, first sector of any bootable device contains machine code instruction to boot a machine and having following info

- Boot Loader (446 bytes)
- Partition Table (64 bytes)
- Error Checking (2 bytes)

> It will load the boot loader(GRUB) into the memory and handover to it.

1. **GRUB(Grand Unified Boot Loader)**

> Load **/boot/grub2/grub.cfg** at boot time

> At this stage, User will see GUI asking different OS  or Kernels configured to boot.

> Once you selected the kernel, it locates the corresponding kernel binary

**/boot/vmlinuz-<kernel-version>**

> Main job is to load kernel and **initrd/initramfs** image into memory

> Once load kernel in RAM, it passes control to it

1. **Kernel** 

First kernel is loaded into read-only mode

> **Initramfs/initrd** gets decompressed and then first loads temporary file system.

> Initrd then detects and load the drivers from temporary filesystem to load actual file system.

> Mount other partitions like LVM (logical volume manager), RAID, etc and unmount itself.

> Once main filesystem is mounted, kernel initialize the first process **init/SystemD.**

> You can fine these images under /boot folder

1. **SystemD**

First service loaded with process ID 1

Start all required processes

**/etc/systemd/system/default.targed**

To bring the system to the run-level/targets (0-6)

>> You can find the different runlevels files under

**/usr/lib/systecd md/system**

**ls -l runlevel***
